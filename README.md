### Disclaimer
In the final steps of this application, it stopped running due to an e.split error in the minified code. I have tried getting my TA and my tutor to help me fix this error to no avail. Please check the code. I have added everything to complete the assignment, it just has a fatal error that I can not find.
### Description

Simply go to the deployed heroku link and use it in the browser or press the install button to use it locally.

This will revolutionize note taking capabilities by allowing you to keep notes without using the internet.
